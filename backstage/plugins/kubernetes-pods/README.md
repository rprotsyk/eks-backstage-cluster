# Kubernetes Pods Plugin

This plugin scans a Kubernetes cluster for pods and creates corresponding entities in Backstage. It also allows users to add new pods via the Backstage UI.

## Features

- Displays Kubernetes pods in a grid
- Allows adding new pods through a modal form
- Automatically syncs new pods with Backstage entities

## Usage

1. Navigate to the "Kubernetes Pods" link in the sidebar.
2. View the list of pods in the grid.
3. Click "Add new pod" to create a new pod in the Kubernetes cluster.

## Configuration

Ensure that your Backstage instance is configured to connect to your Kubernetes cluster. Update the plugin's configuration files as necessary to support your environment.
